# FulcrumDemo

According to the University of California, “wellness is an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a healthy and fulfilling life”.  The university also states that wellness is a dynamic process of change and growth. The Fulcrum application is a native Android application built to help students keep track of their emotional, physical, academic, and social dimensions of wellness. Users fill out a daily survey (modeled off a Likert Scale) that asks students how well they think they handled various situations throughout that day. Based on the results of this survey, Fulcrum calculates wellness scores for each of the four areas. Students can use Fulcrum to track their wellness scores over time. The application is tailored for use by college students.

Fulcrum is being developed by six Georgia Tech students: Yamin Mousselli, Arvind Narayan, Tyler Serrian, Jarrett Serrian, Christian Thai, and Jimmy Dinh. Conor Fitzpatrick has served as an advisor on this project, as have Georgia Tech Professors Olufisayo Omojokun, Casey Wilson, Mary Hudachek-Buswell, and Kelly Ann Fitzpatrick.
